<p>Mapping can be a very useful tool in the realm of Public Archaeology. Whether for navigating a specific site or finding your way from place to place, maps are a great guide and visualisation tool for Public Archaeology.</p>
        <p> This map contains a few of the Public Archaeology sites that can be visited in downtown Victoria. The sites are divided into two general categories:</p>
             <ul>
          <li>Red Pins: Museums and Heritage Sites</li>
          <li>Blue Pins: Signs of Lekwungen</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Museums and Heritage Sites are not organized sequentially, since visitors could spend an entire day at each location. On the other hand, the Signs of Lekwungen are represented as an experience that could be completed in one day by following the directions from location to location. Each of the Red and Blue Pins contain a brief description of the site, as well as a link to the websites for the Museums and Heritage Sites.</p>
          <p> Note: The Signs of Lekwungen descriptions are excerpted from the City of Victoria's "Signs of Lekwungen" brochure.</p>
